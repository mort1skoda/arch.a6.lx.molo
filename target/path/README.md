# tmux-named-snapshot

This plugin will allow you to save and restore
[tmux-resurrect](https://github.com/tmux-plugins/tmux-resurrect) snapshots
into its own separate snapshot, making it easy to keep track of tmux session setup.

## Getting Started

This plugin is shipped with these key bindings

- `Prefix + Ctrl-m`: Save 'manual' snapshot
- `Prefix + M`: Prompt for a name and save the snapshot under that name
- `Prefix + Ctrl-n`: Restore 'manual' snapshot
- `Prefix + N`: Prompt for a name and restore the snapshot by that name

Check out [Configurations](#configurations) section below to customize the
key bindings and any additional options.

## Configurations

- `@named-snapshot-save`  
Description: A list of key mapping to be bound to save command  
Default: `C-m:manual M:*`  
Values: a space separated keymap, in which consists of comma separated strings
- `@named-snapshot-restore`  
Description: A list of key mapping to be bound to restore command  
Default: `C-n:manual N:*`  
Values: a space separated keymap, in which consists of comma separated strings

Each mapping should consists of key and its corresponding snapshot name. So
a mapping of `C-m:manual` will map a `manual` snapshot to `C-m` key binding.

A special snapshot name `*` will prompt for a snapshot name before
performing the action.

You can always map multiple key bindings to the same snapshot name.

### Examples

To setup the key bindings, the configuration should be put in `.tmux.conf`
file.

For example,

```
set -g @named-snapshot-save 'C-m:manual M:* C-d:dev'
set -g @named-snapshot-restore 'C-n:manual N:* D:dev'
```

will setup the following key bindings

- `Prefix + Ctrl-m`: Save 'manual' snapshot
- `Prefix + M`: Prompt for a name and save the snapshot under that name
- `Prefix + Ctrl-d`: Save 'dev' snapshot
- `Prefix + Ctrl-n`: Restore 'manual' snapshot
- `Prefix + N`: Prompt for a name and restore the snapshot by that name
- `Prefix + D`: Restore 'dev' snapshot
